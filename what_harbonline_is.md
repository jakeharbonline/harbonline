# What Harbonline Is

## Brand Definition

**Harbonline** is Jake's freelance web development practice. I help businesses scale online with fast, accessible websites and web applications that actually work. No agencies, no middlemen—just direct collaboration to build digital products that drive results.

## Mission

To help businesses grow online through exceptional web development — combining technical expertise with a friendly, collaborative approach that makes the whole process genuinely enjoyable.

## What I Do

I'm a full-stack freelance developer who builds anything you need for the web:

### Core Services

**Websites That Convert**
Fast-loading, mobile-friendly websites that look great and rank well on Google. Whether you need a simple landing page or a full e-commerce site, I've got you covered.

**Web Applications**
Custom tools built for your specific needs—dashboards, client portals, booking systems, SaaS products. If you can describe it, I can build it.

**E-Commerce**
Online stores that make it easy for customers to buy and easy for you to manage. From product catalogues to payment processing.

**Full-Stack Development**
Front-end, back-end, databases, APIs—I handle the whole stack. One person, no handoffs, clear communication throughout.

## Who I Work With

I partner with:
- Small to medium businesses ready to level up their online presence
- Startups needing a technical co-founder without the equity commitment
- Companies wanting bespoke tools to automate workflows and save time
- Anyone who values quality work and straight-talking collaboration

## How I Work

### Principles

**Results-Focused**
I care about outcomes, not just deliverables. Your website needs to drive traffic, generate leads, or make sales—that's what I optimise for.

**Fast & Accessible**
Every site I build targets Lighthouse scores of 95+ and works perfectly for all users, including those with disabilities. It's not optional—it's how I work.

**Clear Communication**
No jargon, no fluff. I explain things in plain English and keep you updated throughout. You'll always know where we're at.

**Built to Last**
Clean, maintainable code using modern tools. When I hand over a project, you'll be set up for long-term success—not locked into working with me forever.

**Honest Advice**
If something's a bad idea, I'll tell you. If there's a simpler solution, I'll suggest it. I'd rather save you money than pad the invoice.

## Tone of Voice

### Characteristics

**Friendly & Approachable**
I'm here to help, not impress you with technical speak. Let's chat like normal humans.

**Confident but Humble**
I know my stuff and deliver quality work, but I'm not arrogant about it. We're collaborating, not competing.

**Honest & Direct**
No BS. I set realistic timelines, deliver on promises, and admit when I don't know something (then go learn it).

**Casual but Professional**
Think smart casual—relaxed and personable, but you can trust me with your business.

**Value-Focused**
Everything's about what I can do for you. Not about how clever the tech is, but how it helps your business grow.

### Writing Style

- Use **British English** spelling and grammar
- Speak directly to the reader ("I'll help you...", "Let's build...")
- Keep it conversational but clear
- Use real examples over vague claims
- Avoid corporate jargon and clichés
- Be human—use contractions (I'm, you're, let's)
- Focus on benefits to the client, not features

---

## Visual Style

### Aesthetic

**Modern & Clean**
Dark, sophisticated aesthetic with plenty of breathing room. Nothing cluttered or busy.

**Friendly Professionalism**
Polished enough to be taken seriously, approachable enough to feel welcoming.

**Bold & Confident**
Strong typography, high contrast, clear hierarchy. Not trying too hard to be trendy.

**Accessible & Inclusive**
High contrast ratios, readable fonts, works for everyone. Design that actually functions.

---

## What Harbonline Is NOT

- **Not an agency** — Just me, Jake. Direct communication, no bureaucracy.
- **Not the cheapest** — Quality costs, but you get what you pay for.
- **Not a template shop** — Everything's built custom for your needs.
- **Not rushed** — I take on projects I can deliver well, not everything that comes my way.
- **Not corporate** — Friendly, human, straight-talking service.

---

## Why Work With Me

**One Person, Full Accountability**
No project managers or account handlers. You work directly with the person building your site.

**Technical Excellence**
Lighthouse 95+ scores, WCAG AA accessibility, clean code. I don't cut corners.

**Business-Focused**
I care about your KPIs—traffic, conversions, revenue. The tech serves the business goals.

**Flexible & Adaptable**
Freelance means I can pivot quickly and tailor my approach to suit you.

**Long-Term Partner**
I'm here for ongoing support and growth, not just to launch and disappear.
