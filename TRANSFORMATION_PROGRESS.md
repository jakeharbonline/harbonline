## üé® Design Notes from Mockup Analysis

**Dark Aesthetic:**
- Pure black backgrounds (#000 or very close)
- Cream/beige 3D abstract shapes for visual interest
- Glassmorphism cards
- Large, bold typography
- Generous white space

**Current Implementation:**
- Using dark theme (#0A0A0A backgrounds)
- Glassmorphism effects in place
- Gradient shapes as placeholders
- Bold headings with gradient text

**To Match Mockup More Closely:**
- Consider darker background (#000000 instead of #0A0A0A)
- Add 3D wavy shape elements (can source or create SVGs)
- Larger, bolder headlines
- More dramatic spacing

## ‚ùì Questions for Jake

1. **Email Address**: What email should I use for the "Let's Chat" button?
   - Currently using: `hello@harbonline.com`
   - Update if different

2. **Navigation Structure**: Confirm final nav:
   - Option A: Home | Work | About | Contact
   - Option B: Home | Services | Work | Contact
   - Option C: Home | Work | Contact (simpler)

3. **Services Pages**: Should I:
   - Merge all services into homepage?
   - Keep separate `/services` page?
   - Remove individual service detail pages?

4. **About Section**: Should there be a dedicated About page, or just a section on homepage?
